# [TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

- Unit Tests are written to test the output of your code - *TDD* is where you write the code first this is - Test Driven Development

- The main concept is to write the test for the code first - before any code is even written

*When writing tests:*

- Think "baby steps"

- pay attention to the title, should be descriptive
- the test file should have the same name but w/ ``test_`` in front

## Structure - AAA

- Arrange : (input) organize the data going in 
- Act : (exercise the behavior) execute the code
- Assert : (output) check the result after running code

Suggested to us pytest to execute the tests
